      <p>
        I’m energized by how modern tools — especially AI — are making it possible for businesses to move faster, make better decisions, and do more with fewer resources.
      </p>
      <p>I’ve also been an entrepreneur and business owner since 2005, which means I approach every recommendation with an eye toward profitability, sustainability, and real-world tradeoffs — not just what’s technically possible.</p>
      <p>I’ve been building internal apps and workflows on top of tools like Google Sheets and Docs, using AI-assisted development to dramatically reduce build time and cost while improving visibility and decision-making.</p>
