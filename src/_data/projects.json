Hardened the navigation with accessible mega menus, header tab panels, Kadence off-canvas controls, ReciteMe + Google Translate helpers, and skip-link/keyboard workflows. Imported legacy shop/dine + art content via WP All Import + ACF, added custom tax queries, Gravity Forms, and FacetWP filters so the airport team could manage everything without editors calling an engineer.",
